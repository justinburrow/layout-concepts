/* PDP Horizonal Slide
    Shows a desktop-centric view of a PDP, where all image views
    for the product are aligned horizontally in a strip, and the image
    takes up the entire browser viewport.  Alternate image views slide in
    when a preview image is clicked, and the details sit on one half
    of the screen in containers that blur the image beneath.
